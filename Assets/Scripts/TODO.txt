===================       TODO      =========================
-------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
 GENERAL
-----------
1. Extract utils to package
2. LERP bullet position for smoothness

-----------
 REFACTORS
-----------

1. Make turning the character smoother with LERP
2. Add turn animations
3. Clean up physics test variables/functions
4. Add ability for ballistics engine to watch multiple projectiles (now can only simulate one)
5. Make an interface for projectiles (i.e. IBallisticBehavior), grab them on startup/construction and hide the physics away by inheriting

-------------
 NICE TO HAVE 
-------------

1. Bullet penetration
2. Calculate damage based on energy

-------------
   ISSUES 
-------------

- Problem with bullet not following path: predictive formula was using currentTime, actual ballistics 
calculation was using timeStep. Need to find the correct formula (review them) (SOLVED)
- Ballistics trajectory no longer an arc
